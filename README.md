# Product Sales Predictive Analysis
## Location Type Largest Determining Factor
### Author: Ben Fajack

This analysis is designed to inform the stakeholders on how to optimize future locations infratructure and product procurement and placement.

The database was cleaned and explored using various EDA functions. Correlations between various product and location features were examined as were predictive algorithms when trying to determine future sales at individual locations.

### Results
The largest predictive factor according to the analysis was the type of location. Certain designs, sizes of locations produced the most consistent correlations with the target.

As can be seen here there is a low possibility of correlation between any one Item Type and furutre overall sales at a location

Here, it easy to see that Supermarket Type 3 is performing considerably better in overall sales.


## Models
Various EDA functions were utilized to determine correlations and obtain visualizations with the dataset. An optimized regression tree model was used for predictive analysis. It can account for approximately 60% of the variance after tuning.

Additional information contributing to a better understanding of how the "Type 3" Supermarket is outperforming other types would allow for detailed recommendations and a more nuanced predictive model. Current accuracy in the predictive models is only moderate but could be enhanced significantly with more good data surrounding the location types.
